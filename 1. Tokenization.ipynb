Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam was indeed one of the most humble, intelligent, \n",

Not only this, but he also is one of the most famous scientists who have worked with highly famous organizations like DRDO (Defense Research and Development Organization) and ISRO (Indian Space Research Organization) in his career.\n",
    "\n",
    "He was a true gem and a person with no haters. But let us first know a little more about him. His full name was Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam. He was born in a middle-class Muslim family. Since the beginning of his days, he was a very hardworking and diligent person. In his early childhood, he helped his family to earn livelihood along with the studies. Being very intelligent and promising, he started his career and life soon.\n",
    "\n",
    "He saw a lot of hardships on his way to success. There was a time when his sister sold her jewelry to pay his college fees. After completing his graduation, he joined the defense department to serve the nation. And from there the journey of the famous scientist started to a never-ending tale of success. He was one of the various scientists in India who worked for the development of nuclear power. For his work, he also earned various awards and prizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dr. Kalam was one of the most important figures in the testing of the Pokhran-II in the year 1988. Politics never attracted Dr. Kalam. But in the year 2002, Indian National Democratic Alliance requested him to nominate him for the post of the President. Thinking of the nation and keen eagerness to work for the country, made him say yes. With the support of the Indian National Democratic Alliance, he won the elections and was selected as the President of India.\n",
    "\n",
    "He was a man of dreams and ideas. He dreamt of making India one of the super-powers in the world. His idea of dreaming was really different. He emphasized that the dreams are not those which you see when you sleep but are those which never let you sleep. Undoubtedly, these are the precious words of wisdom. He always encouraged everyone to work hard and not think about the result. He believed, if you work hard, you will definitely get the result as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some countless efforts and contributions are made by Dr. Kalam for the sake of the nation. He was awarded by Bharat Ratna in the year 1997. But, the biggest grief is that we have no longer this beautiful amongst us. While delivering his speech at the Institute of Management, Shillong he got cardiac arrest and collapsed. Even after great efforts, he left us, making 27 July 2015 one of the saddest days in the history of India.\n",
    "\n",
    "At last, I would like to say even though he left us, he is still in our hearts as the inspiration and the motivation. His golden words and miraculous deeds will always be remembered. He was a man of high stature and value who taught us the way to transform our nation and we shall always be grateful to him.\n",
